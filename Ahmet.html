        <blockquote>Hi, I'm Ryyan, currently a third-year student at North American University. When I'm not buried
            in
            textbooks or
            lectures, you can find me out on the field, enjoying my passion for sports like cricket, soccer, and
            any
            outdoor game
            that gets my adrenaline pumping. Beyond sports, I'm a self-proclaimed foodie with a knack for
            discovering new culinary
            delights. Being an extrovert, I thrive in group settings, where collaboration and teamwork fuel my
            drive. Looking ahead,
            my aim is to delve deeper into the world of technology by mastering Python and SQL, with aspirations
            of
            becoming a
            proficient database administrator and data analyst.</blockquote>
