        <blockquote>Hi, I'm Ahmet, currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree at North American University. With a
            bachelor's and master's degree already under my belt, I've always been driven by a thirst for knowledge and
            a passion for continuous learning. Soccer has been a significant part of my life, having played at a
            professional level for 15 years, instilling in me values of discipline, resilience, and teamwork. Additionally, I have proudly served in the military for 2 years, where I
            learned invaluable lessons in leadership and teamwork. With a diverse background and a drive to excel, I'm
            excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the world of cloud development, and I'm committed to
            making meaningful contributions in this field.</blockquote>
