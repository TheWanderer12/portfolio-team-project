        Hi, I'm Ravil. I am a senior student at North American University. Problem-solving has been my strong
        skill since childhood, where I enjoyed math and mostly technical subjects at school. I always tried to be
        amongst the top, and still do. I like playing video games, such that tell a story. I am not into books, but I
        like good stories, so I feel like I should be reading them. I like playing chess as a hobby, which my dad taught
        me when I was in primary school. When it comes to coding, Python was the first programming language I picked up,
        and I still appreciate its simplicity, however, I have the most experience in Java, since that is what I
        learned in my freshman year of University, and kept using it for solving different problems. I like getting
        insights about hardware works as well. I am looking forward to build my own PC.

        Since I am a senior student, I am looking for a job in the software development field. I am interested in web
        development nowadays, because I have been learning JavaScript actively, and want to utilize it. On the other
        hand, I can still make use of my good-old Java. In order to achieve my goal, I am looking to get some
        certifications such as AWS, and create more projects while I still have time. I am also looking to get an
        internship to get some experience in the field, and learn from professionals. I am looking to work in a company
        where I can grow, and learn new things, and where I can be a part of a team that is working on something big.
        <br>
        I am interested in trading as well, such as stocks and crypto, so I am looking to get some experience in that
        field as well for financial growth. There is a big learning curve, but I am willing to learn and grow.

        <h4>* Expense Tracker *
        </h4>
        <li>
          I worked on the expense tracker project during my Software Engineering course, where the goal was to help
          users track their daily expenses and gain insights into their spending habits. It allowed users to add
          expenses, calculate total spending per category, and generate a summary of their spending habits. I used
          Python for this project.
        </li>
        <br>
        <h4>* Snake game *
        </h4>
        <li> I wrote a python program to recreate the snake game with my custom textures. I used Python for this project
          as well, with pygame library. I created a simple game loop and used arrays to keep track of the different body
          parts of the snake. I also implemented collision detection to check if the snake has hit the wall or itself.
