      <blockquote>Hi, I'm Ahmet, currently pursuing my second bachelor's degree at North American University. With
        a
        bachelor's and master's degree already under my belt, I've always been driven by a thirst for knowledge
        and
        a passion for continuous learning. Soccer has been a significant part of my life, having played at a
        professional level for 15 years, instilling in me values of discipline, resilience, and teamwork.
        Additionally, I have proudly served in the military for 2 years, where I
        learned invaluable lessons in leadership and teamwork. With a diverse background and a drive to excel,
        I'm
        excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the world of cloud development, and I'm committed to
        making meaningful contributions in this field.</blockquote>
